			<h1 style="text-decoration: underline">Summary</h1>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The Energy Escalation Rate Calculator (EERC) computes a compound annual average rate of escalation for a
				specified time period, which can be used as an escalation rate for contract payments in Energy Savings
				Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Service Contracts (UESCs). These escalation rates are based on
				energy price projections from the Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA). While the
				underlying energy price projections vary from year to year, for calculating contract payments the single
				EERC-calculated uniform average rate is preferable. The rate is stated in real (excluding inflation) and nominal
				(including inflation) terms and weighted by the share of each of the energy types used in the project.
				Alternatively, an escalation rate for each energy type can be computed separately.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				EERC was redeveloped in 2025 to match the Building Life Cycle Cost (BLCC) web application design and included
				two significant changes. First, an option for “Data Release Year” has been included, which allows a user to see
				compound annual average escalation rates from previous release years to validate analysis that used an older
				version of EERC. The current version includes data for 2024 and 2025. Second, the option to include an explicit
				economic cost for energy-related emissions was removed from EERC because the EIA projections used by EERC
				already internalize emissions market impacts on regions of the country for which emissions trading markets
				influence the energy markets.
			</p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">EERC prompts the user for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Data Release Year</li>
				<li>Customer Sector Type</li>
				<li>Project Location (state)</li>
				<li>Fuel Type</li>
				<li>Contract Start Date</li>
				<li>Duration of Contract</li>
				<li>Annual Inflation Rate</li>
			</ul>

			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Default values are provided for the inflation rate (based on annual supplement value). The discount rate is
				fixed based on the Annual Supplement.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Based on the user inputs, EERC retrieves the relevant energy price forecasts and computes the compound annual
				average escalation rate, as described above. Since the performance period generally begins a year or more later
				than the contract award date, the calculated compound annual average rate includes the price escalation for the
				intervening year(s). Escalation is assumed to take place during this period.
			</p>

			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The calculated compound annual average escalation rate is reported in both real (excluding inflation) and
				nominal (including inflation) terms. The energy price projections for all scenarios exclude inflation and thus
				generate real rates. The default inflation rate used in the EERC is the long-term inflation rate calculated
				annually by NIT for DOE Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) using the average annual inflation estimates
				for the next 10 years from the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) Analytical Perspectives and the
				methodology described in 10 CFR 436 Subpart A, but without consideration of the 3.0 % floor for the real
				discount rate. The default inflation rate does not account for the discount rate floor to accommodate the need
				for market-based projections of future energy prices in contract negotiations. Otherwise, the default inflation
				rate would be artificially low in years when the 3.0 % floor applies.

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				To calculate the nominal escalation rate, which includes inflation, the calculator uses the following
				relationship:

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				The calculated compound annual average escalation rate, <i>e<sub>avg</sub></i
				>, when applied to the base- year energy costs or savings of ESPC or UESC projects, results in approximately the
				same undiscounted total amounts over the performance period as do the EIA-projected, or adjusted EIA-projected,
				variable rates. If more than one fuel is used in the project, the EERC weights the average escalation rate
				according to the proportions stated by the user.
			</p>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				To compute a compound annual average escalation rate, base-year (i.e., award year) energy costs are escalated
				from year to year at rates projected by EIA to arrive at the total energy cost over a given performance period.
				The escalation rates, e, are projected by census division, energy type, and industrial sector and vary from year
				to year. The formula used EERC prompts the user for information on the share of cost savings attributable to
				each fuel type, project location, industry sector, and the beginning date and duration of the performance
				period. Then it retrieves the relevant energy price forecasts and computes the compound annual average
				escalation rate, as described above.
			</p>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">The formula to calculate total energy costs is:</p>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<img height="50" id="Picture 10" src="./EERC User Guide - 2025_files/image002.png" />

			<p class="MsoNormal">where</p>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>C</i> is the undiscounted total of future energy costs over the performance period</p>

			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>A</i> is the base-year annual cost</p>

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				<i>e<sub>i</sub></i> is the annual escalation rate, which varies from year to year over the performance period
			</p>

			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>n</i> is the number of years in the performance period</p>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				When the escalation rate is the same in each year of the study period, the series can be simplified to a factor
				applied to the base-year annual cost, A:

			</p>
			<br />

			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Since a uniform escalation rate is needed to compute the contract payments in ESPC and UESC projects, the EERC
				uses this equation to approximate <i>C</i>, as calculated with EIA rates or adjusted EIA rates, and iteratively
				solves for <i>e<sub>avg</sub></i
				>, the compound annual average escalation rate. The relationship between the factor calculated in the equation
				and the variable escalation rates in the series can be expressed as follows for a performance period of n years
