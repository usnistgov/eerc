<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EERC computes an average rate of escalation for a specified
time period, which can be used as an escalation rate for contract payments in
ESPCs and UESCs. These escalation rates are based on energy price projections
from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA). While
the underlying energy price projections vary from year to year, for calculating
contract payments the single EERC-calculated uniform average rate is
preferable. The rate is stated in real (excluding inflation) and nominal
(including inflation) terms and weighted by the share of each of the energy
types used in the project. Alternatively, an escalation rate for each energy
type can be computed separately.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To assist federal agencies (and others) in considering a
range of energy price and policy scenarios, escalation rates may be adjusted by
NIST for three levels of estimated social cost of carbon (SCC). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The EIA projections adjusted by NIST for carbon pricing are
based on three SCC projections provided in the Interagency Working Group on
Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases Interim Estimates, which were developed
pursuant to Executive Order 13990. Those estimates are adjusted by NIST to 2023
dollars. The scenarios assume different discount rates and projection
percentile,  providing a range of values that can be used for sensitivity
analysis. Note that this approach was implemented in the 2023 release,
replacing the previous methodology that used carbon pricing projections based
on proposed carbon cap-and-trade legislation from 2009. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prior (executeable) user interface is shown below (left).
The user provides the fuel type, fuel rate, study period, carbon pricing
scenario, and inflation rate. Default values are provided for projected SCC
scenarios (SCC of zero) and inflation rate (based on annual supplement value). The
discount rate is fixed based on the Annual Supplement. The output is a real
escalation rate and nominal escalation rate values. The flow diagram for the
EERC workflow including the required data is shown below (right).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EERC prompts the user for information on the share of cost
savings attributable to each fuel type, the project location, industry sector,
and beginning date and duration of the project term. It also prompts the user
to select one of several estimated SCC scenarios -- no SCC, low, medium, or high
-- then retrieves the relevant energy price forecasts and computes the average
escalation rate, as described above. Since the performance period generally begins
a year or more later than the contract award date, the calculated average rate
includes the price escalation for the intervening year(s). Escalation is
assumed to take place during this period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The calculated average escalation rate is reported in both
real (excluding inflation) and nominal (including inflation) terms. The energy
price projections for all scenarios exclude inflation and thus generate real
rates. The default inflation rate used in the EERC is the long-term inflation
rate calculated annually by DOE/FEMP using the average annual inflation estimates
for the next 10 years from the White House Council of Economic Advisors (CEA)
Analytical Perspectives and the methodology described in 10 CFR 436, but
without consideration of the 3.0 % floor for the real discount rate. The
default inflation rate does not account for the discount rate floor to
accommodate the need for market-based projections of future energy prices in
contract negotiations. Otherwise, the default inflation rate would be
artificially low in years when the 3.0 % floor applies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To calculate the nominal escalation rate, which includes inflation,
the calculator uses the following relationship:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=22 id="Picture 12"
src="EERC%20User%20Guide.fld/image003.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The calculated average annual escalation rate, <i>e<sub>avg</sub></i>,
when applied to the base-year energy costs or savings of ESPC or UESC projects,
results in approximately the same undiscounted total amounts over the
performance period as do the EIA-projected, or adjusted EIA-projected, variable
rates. If more than one fuel is used in the project, the EERC weights the
average escalation rate according to the proportions stated by the user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To compute an average annual escalation rate, base-year (i.e.,
award year) energy costs are escalated from year to year at rates projected by
EIA, or at EIA rates adjusted by NIST for carbon pricing, to arrive at the
total energy cost over a given performance period. The escalation rates, e, are
projected by census region, energy type, and industrial sector and vary from
year to year. The formula used EERC prompts the user for information on the
share of cost savings attributable to each fuel type, project location, industry
sector, and the beginning date and duration of the performance period. It also
prompts the user to select one of several carbon pricing scenarios -- no carbon
pricing, low, medium, or high --then retrieves the relevant energy price
forecasts and computes the average escalation rate, as described above. Since
the performance period begins later than the base date, the calculated average
rate includes the price escalation for the intervening year(s).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to calculate total energy costs is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=38 id="Picture 10"
src="EERC%20User%20Guide.fld/image004.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>C</i> is the undiscounted total of future energy costs
over the performance period</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>A</i> is the base-year annual cost</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>e<sub>i</sub></i> is the annual escalation rate, which
varies from year to year over the performance period</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>n</i> is the number of years in the performance period</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the escalation rate is the same in each year of the
study period, the series can be simplified to a factor applied to the base-year
annual cost, A:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=52 id="Content Placeholder 6"
src="EERC%20User%20Guide.fld/image005.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where <i>e<sub>avg</sub></i> is the average annual
escalation rate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since a uniform escalation rate is needed to compute the
contract payments in ESPC and UESC projects, the EERC uses this equation to
approximate <i>C</i>, as calculated with EIA rates or adjusted EIA rates, and
iteratively solves for <i>e<sub>avg</sub></i>, the average annual escalation
rate. The relationship between the factor calculated in the equation and the
variable escalation rates in the series can be expressed as follows for a
performance period of <i>n</i> years duration:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=624 height=71 id="Picture 4"
src="EERC%20User%20Guide.fld/image006.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cost of carbon is calculated using the emissions per
unit of fuel type, the SCC projections, and the carbon emissions factor to
calculate a price per unit of fuel. Then its added into the projected energy
prices before the escalation rate is calculated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For electricity, take the baseline CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions
rate for a state and create the emissions rate for each year by multiplying it
by the emission factor for that state (fraction of baseline emissions rate by
year). This value is then multiplied by the SCC from the projected SCC scenario
by year. This provides the carbon price per unit of electricity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions rates for other fuels
(distillate oil, residual oil, nat gas, LPG, and coal) are based on EPA’s relevant
emissions hub. These rates do not change by year. Therefore, the emissions per
unit are constant over time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The energy price is adjusted by the cost of carbon per unit
of fuel (assuming a 100% pass-through to the retail price). This is added
before the escalation rates are calculated so that the escalation rates are
appropriated adjusted for the carbon scenario. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The purpose of including the carbon cost is to adjust future
energy prices to incorporate the social cost of carbon. Current energy prices have
not internalized any of these external costs. Therefore, it is not appropriate
to add the price of carbon to the base year energy prices. Instead, the
addition of carbon to energy prices initially occurs for every year after the
base year, similar to what would happen to energy prices if legislation were to
require energy producers to pay the estimated social cost of carbon on their
production starting at the end of the base year. Alternatively, you could think
of it as a federal agency deciding to start including the social cost of carbon
into the costs considered for future energy consumption. The exceptions are
California and the 12 northeastern states that are part of the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which each have a carbon market with average
carbon prices of approximately $34 and $14 at the most recent auctions,
respectively, at release of this document.</p>
